# Football Field Booking App

Full-stack football field booking platform built with React, Express, Sequelize, and MySQL.

## Overview

This project lets players, captains, field owners, and admins manage football fields, bookings, teams, matches, and notifications in one application.

The repository contains:
- `frontend/`: React client
- `backend/`: Express API with Sequelize models and MySQL integration

## Features

- Authentication with JWT and role-based access control
- Public browsing for fields, teams, and league data pages
- Team creation, team management, and member requests
- Field listing, field details, and owner field management
- Booking flow for matches and field reservations
- Notifications and profile/settings pages
- Owner dashboard and booking management views
- Admin user management and role request review
- Demo seed script with sample users, fields, teams, bookings, and match history
- Optional live league standings and match data via `football-data.org`

## Role Relationships

The application is organized around four active roles plus public visitors. Each role has a clear relationship to the others:

| Role | Primary responsibility | Works most closely with | Typical interactions |
|------|------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Guest | Browse public content | Players, captains, field owners | View public fields and teams, then register for an account |
| Player | Join teams and participate in matches | Captains | Request to join teams, manage profile, follow bookings and match activity |
| Captain | Organize teams and create team-side bookings | Players, field owners | Create teams, manage members, invite players, request bookings, open matches |
| Field owner | Manage venues and booking approval | Captains, admins | Create and update fields, review bookings, manage owner dashboard data |
| Admin | Govern the platform | All roles | Review role requests, manage users, oversee platform activity |

### How roles connect

- Guests become authenticated users by registering, and new accounts default to `player`.
- Players are the entry point for team participation. They can join teams and later request a role upgrade.
- Captains are team operators. They coordinate players and interact with field owners to secure matches and bookings.
- Field owners are venue operators. They do not manage teams directly, but they are the key counterpart for captains during the booking flow.
- Admins are platform supervisors. They do not replace the day-to-day role of captain or owner, but they can intervene across all areas.

### Role upgrade path

- A new user starts as `player`.
- A player can request upgrade to `captain` or `field_owner`.
- An admin reviews and approves or rejects role requests.
- Once approved, access changes immediately because the backend resolves the latest role from the database on authenticated requests.

### Collaboration model in the app

- `Player <-> Captain`: team membership, invitations, join requests, and match participation.
- `Captain <-> Field owner`: field reservations, booking confirmation, match scheduling, and venue coordination.
- `Captain <-> Admin`: escalations, moderation, and role-governed access to team-related flows.
- `Field owner <-> Admin`: owner permissions, field oversight, and dispute resolution.
- `Admin <-> Everyone`: user management, role governance, and system-wide visibility.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- MySQL 8+ or MariaDB
- npm

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install

cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Configure the backend

Create `backend/.env`:

```env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=replace_with_a_secret_at_least_32_characters_long
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_NAME=football_booking
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password

CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
RATE_LIMITING=true
HTTP_LOGGING=true
DB_SYNC_ALTER=false
APP_TIMEZONE=Asia/Bangkok

# Optional: enables league data pages
FOOTBALL_API_KEY=your_football_data_org_api_key
```

Notes:
- `JWT_SECRET` is required and must be at least 32 characters.
- If `FOOTBALL_API_KEY` is missing, the league endpoints return `503` and the rest of the app still works.

### 3. Create the database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE football_booking;
```

### 4. Seed demo data

From `backend/`:

```bash
npm run seed
```

Sample seeded accounts:
- `admin1@example.com / Password123`
- `field_owner2@example.com / Password123`
- `captain5@example.com / Password123`
- `player10@example.com / Password123`

### 5. Start the backend

From `backend/`:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Backend URLs:
- API root: `http://localhost:5000/`
- Health check: `http://localhost:5000/health`

### 6. Start the frontend

From `frontend/`:

```bash
npm start
```

Frontend URL:
- `http://localhost:3000`

The frontend defaults to `/api` and uses the local proxy in development, so a frontend `.env` file is optional unless you want to override `REACT_APP_API_URL`.

## Available Scripts

### Backend

```bash
npm start       # start server
npm run dev     # start with nodemon
npm run seed    # reset and seed demo data
npm run db:create
npm test
```

### Frontend

```bash
npm start
npm run build
npm test
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix
```

## Main Routes

### Frontend pages
- Public: `/`, `/fields`, `/fields/:id`, `/teams`, `/teams/:id`, `/league`, `/login`, `/register`
- App area: `/app/dashboard`, `/app/teams`, `/app/bookings`, `/app/open-matches`, `/app/notifications`, `/app/profile`, `/app/settings`
- Owner area: `/owner/dashboard`, `/owner/fields`, `/owner/bookings`, `/owner/matches`
- Admin area: `/app/admin/users`, `/app/admin/role-requests`

### Backend API
- `POST /api/auth/register`
- `POST /api/auth/login`
- `GET /api/auth/profile`
- `GET /api/users`
- `GET /api/fields`
- `GET /api/bookings`
- `GET /api/teams`
- `GET /api/public/teams`
- `GET /api/team-members`
- `GET /api/match-results`
- `GET /api/notifications`
- `GET /api/ratings`
- `GET /api/dashboard/stats`
- `GET /api/matches`
- `GET /api/leagues/standings`

## Uploads and Static Assets

Uploaded files are served from:
- `frontend/public/uploads/`
- `backend/uploads/` for backward compatibility

If a field image is missing, the backend falls back to `frontend/public/hero-manu.jpg`.

## Notes for Development

- The backend validates required environment variables during startup.
- In development, Sequelize runs a safe sync by default.
- Set `DB_SYNC_ALTER=true` only if you explicitly want alter-based schema sync.
- The server applies rate limiting, CORS, helmet, compression, and centralized error handling.

## Current Scope

This root README documents the app as it is currently wired in `backend/server.js` and `frontend/src/App.js`.
Some extra backend files exist for future or partial features, but the routes listed above are the ones currently mounted by the main server.
